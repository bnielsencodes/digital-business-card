      <p>
        Fully committed to the philosophy of life-long learning, Iâ€™m a front-end
        web developer with a deep passion for all things web development.

        Coming from a background in behavioral health, I bring an analytical yet
        creative approach to problem solving that lends itself well to the
        design and creation of aesthetic and intuitive user experiences.
